# pywebserver
Just a simple HTTP server made in Python.
Make sure to read the documentation.
This was just a little side project though I might make new additions later on such as HTTPS support.

Supported languages: HTML, JS, CSS\n
PHP and nodejs is not supported on the server currently and are served as plain text files if its enabled in the config.
